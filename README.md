# Gunnery

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gunnery/gunnery.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gunnery/gunnery)

Gunnery is a multipurpose task execution tool for distributed systems with web-based interface.

If your application is divided into multiple servers, you are probably connecting to them via ssh and executing over and over the same commands. Clearing caches, restarting services, backups, checking health. Wouldn't it be cool if you could do that from browser or smartphone? Gunnery is here for you!
